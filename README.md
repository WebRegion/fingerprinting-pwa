# Browser Fingerprinting (Honours Project)

## Project Abstract
Browser fingerprinting is an emerging technique to identify users through their device, from screen size, resolution, and frame rate to more individual characteristics such as browser, font preferences and installed extension(s). Enabling websites that deploy the technique (over many domains) to track users by linking their fingerprints to the websites visited. 

Fingerprinting provides a system for tracking users and a framework for reducing fraud-based attacks via social engineering (in those circumstances where an attacker convinces users to share login information). It provides a verification system on sensitive accounts (such as financial, medical and government), enabling an extra line of protection and a possible reduction in cyber-crime.

The project will demonstrate the ability of browser fingerprinting to track users, utilising information shared by their device while browsing a website with the technology embedded. All the tests in this project utilise JavaScript to process the data and generate a fingerprint. Therefore, making it compatible with all major browsers as JavaScript is a prominent element of website functionality and delivery.

## Please Note
The project's source comes from my honours project; this project has been built on top of the project and includes more tests and efficient data processing and storage. Any passwords have been changed, and the system powered down and removed. This repository is hosted on GitHub pages can does not allow for the remote storage of data ONLY on the local machine!
